## Introduction 🌟

Agentic RAG‑R1 is an open‑source initiative to build an Agentic Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) system by endowing a base language model with autonomous search & reasoning skills through reinforcement learning (currently using the GRPO algorithm).

### What is Agentic RAG? 💡

Agentic RAG combines two powerful concepts:

- **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines generative power with on‑the‑fly retrieval from external knowledge bases, ensuring factual and up‑to‑date answers.
- **Agentic AI**: Gives the model the ability to decide when to retrieve, what to retrieve, and how to weave the retrieved evidence into its reasoning.

### Architecture 🏗️

Our architecture is inspired by TC‑RAG and features an agent memory stack that orchestrates the full deliberation loop, supporting the following actions:

1. Plan (❌)
2. Reasoning (✅)
3. Backtrack (✅)
4. Summary (✅)
5. Tool Observation – wiki/document/knowledge‑graph search, etc. (✅)
6. Conclusion (✅)

### Training Strategy 🧠

Motivated by DeepSeek-R1, we apply GRPO (Generalized Relevance Policy Optimization) to reinforce the agent's choice of reasoning steps and retrieval actions, effectively boosting both search depth and answer quality.

### Rollout Generation 🔄

## Installation 🛠️

We use conda to manage the environment. Follow these steps to set up:

```bash
conda create -n AgenticRAG python=3.11 -y
conda activate AgenticRAG 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Tools Environment (Optional) 🧰

We provide our search tool repository [ArtSearch](https://github.com/Artessay/ArtSearch) as the search engine, which supports retrieval of information from Wikipedia. You can follow the instructions in that repository to deploy a local instance of the search system.

## Features ✨

- **LoRA Tuning Support** 🔧: Fine-tune efficiently with Low-Rank Adaptation
- **Custom Agent Tools** 🛠️: Integrate your own tools and personal RAG datasets
- **Distributed Training** 🌐: Support for Deepspeed Zero 2 Stage and Zero 3 Stage
- **Efficient Resource Usage** 💻: Support for models up to 32B parameters using only 2 A100 GPUs
- **Tool Calling Reward** 🎯: Enhanced reward model that includes:
  - Accuracy reward
  - Format reward
  - RAG accuracy reward using the RAGAS framework

  The total reward is calculated as:

  $$r_{total} = r_{accuracy} + r_{format} + r_{rag}$$

- **TCRAG Integration** 🔗: Uses TCRAG as the rollout generator

## Results 📊

### Experiment Log on Qwen 2.5-7B-Instruct

![Experiment log](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/591d61aa-d4e4-45e9-a48a-77a01858a24b)

We have made our training logs publicly available at: [SwanLab Training Log](https://swanlab.cn/@devilran/xiaobeir1/runs/ipuoxctxo764rvub20d6h/chart)

### Results on MedQA Test Set 🏥

Our Qwen 2.5-7B-Instruct model was evaluated on the MedQA test set using Qwen‑2.5‑72B as the judge:

| Configuration                        | Format Accuracy | Answer Accuracy |
|-------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Before fine-tuning                  | 39%              | 84%              |
| Before fine-tuning + search         | 56%              | 79%              |
| After fine-tuning (200 steps) + search | 92%              | 87%              |
